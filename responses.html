<h3>RESPONSES</h3>
<h2>Everything planned in the preparedness plan must be implemented during this part. 
This is the immediate action of the people after an emergency or a disaster.
<br>A. Responders
Since this Disaster Response Program if made for this Health Care Center, the Medical team would be the first responders if there would be injured people. 

<br>B. Damage Assessment
If the windows of the Health Care Center are damaged, replacement of storm-proof materials is recommended. 

This part is important since the people who will manage the rebuilding and restoration during the recovery will base on this assessment.

<br>Basic Necessities in the Evacuation Area
All supplies and equipment prepared can be consumed during this time. 

If there is a scarcity of supplies and equipment prepared, some of the relief goods can be of big help. These relief goods may come from other cities, provinces, regions, and even countries that are not affected by the emergency or disaster.
