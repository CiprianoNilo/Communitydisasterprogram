<h3>RECOVERY</h3>
<h2>A. Damaged Windows

<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEngineers and construction workers will be the ones who will man the repairing of these windows with storm-proof materials such as:
Impact-resistant glass or shutters that can withstand high winds and flying debris. 
Heavy-duty frames surrounding the windows that can prevent the walls from collapsing.
