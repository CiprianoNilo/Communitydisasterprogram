<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEmergencies are unexpected occurrences of events that can happen any time. 
<br>Emergency preparedness refers to being safe before, during, and after an emergency or a 
natural hazard. <br> Emergency Preparedness prevents suffering from devastation. Every individual 
in the community has a role in emergency preparedness. <br>One type of emergency preparedness is 
developing a Disaster Response Program that aims to cater to the needs of the people before, during, 
<br>and after a disaster or an emergency. Specifically, it aims to apply the Disaster Risk Reduction Management
 Cycle in preparing for emergencies or disasters.This Disaster Response Program specifically caters in case of a typhoon 
 occurrence, strong or not. Typhoons, as one of the natural hazards that occur in the Philippines,usually causes the biggest 
 devastation to the country; typhoons usually occur more than four times a year. <br>Given that the Philippines is a vulnerable country to 
 disasters, it is difficult for the Filipinos <br> to be resilient.However, with the development of Disaster Response Programs, <br>the local 
 communities can be less vulnerable to these disasters through<br> proper mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery actions. </h2>
